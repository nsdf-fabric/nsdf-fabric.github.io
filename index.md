We are on the cusp of tremendous discoveries in data-driven science, thanks to ongoing investments from NSF and other agencies into shared experimental and computing facilities, including synchrotron light sources, various telescopes, Lepton and Hadron colliders, X-Ray and Neutron Imaging, multispectral satellite imagery, neutrino detectors, and light, confocal, electron and X-Ray microscopes. 

These investments are increasing data generation by orders of magnitude. However, because of traditional funding models and barriers between application domains, scientists still deploy domain-specific data repositories and computational workflows siloed in vertical ecosystems built only for the scientists’ specific projects. As data-driven sciences become more complex, the lack of integration limits the scientists’ ability to manage the ever-increasing amount of data. 

Several national reports have stressed the need for a shared set of services, and major facilities recognize the benefits of adopting such an integrated approach to data.

To address this challenge, we are building a National Science Data Fabric (NSDF) and introducing a novel trans-disciplinary approach for integrated data delivery and access to shared storage, networking, computing, and educational resources that will democratize data-driven scientific discovery.
